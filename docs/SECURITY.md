# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please ensure that you are using a [supported version](https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/wiki/Versions).

Distribution packages are usually [outdated and full of vulnerabilities](https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/wiki/Distribution-Packages).

For a general overview, please first read [security considerations](https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Usage/Security.md) as it pervades the architecture of the software.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

We understand and accept that some researchers prefer full-disclosure, but we would prefer to have a heads up prior to the release of the vulnerability details.

Critical bugs are usually fixed (if reproducible) within hours, rather than days or weeks. Though making a new release does take a little bit longer.
Even more so for vulnerabilities.

Please contact [security@xpra.org](mailto:security@xpra.org)
